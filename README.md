<h1> Neural Network to read handwritten digits </h1><br>

<b> TODO </b>
- Fix the Neural Net !

<b> About the Neural Net </b>
This is a simple feed forward Neural Network and the
current implementation is based on the tutorial by: 
David Miller http://vimeo.com/19569529

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples,
and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.
The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28)

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques 
and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal 
efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
