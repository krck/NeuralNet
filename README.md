<h1> Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits </h1><br>

<b> About the Neural Network </b> <br>
This is a simple, fully connected, feed forward <br>
and backpropagation Neural Network written in C++ <br>

<br>
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, <br>
and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. <br>
The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28) <br>
<br>
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques <br>
and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal <br> 
efforts on preprocessing and formatting. <br>

<b> TODO </b>
- <b>DONE</b> Fix the neural net
- <b>DONE</b> Add test Function and test Export
- Add Network Export & Import
- <b>DONE</b> Enable multiple training iterations
- <b>DONE</b> Cleaned up main() Function
- Further cleanup and optimization
